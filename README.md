# gensim_svd_wppmi

Reuses Gensim API for SVD PPMI

Currently trying to figure what is really different in W_PPMI from the paper "Influence of Down-Sampling Strategies 
on SVD Word Embedding Stability" whose code can be found at 
[this repo](https://github.com/hellrich/embedding_downsampling_comparison)

Reused the original implementation found in the notebook 
[there](https://github.com/johndpope/summerschool/blob/master/assignment/classifier/3-Embeddings_SVD_Viz.ipynb)
